# Great Learning Capstone Project

## Chatbot Utility for Industrial Accident Severity Classification using NLP techniques


### Description
This project was developed as part of the Capstone for the Post Graduation Program in AI/ML.
The aim is to develop a Chatbot Utility that can classify the severity of the industrial accident based on the accident description.


### Features
 ** Interim Report **
 - Used NLP techniques like stop word removal, tokenization using NLTJ to preprocess the accident Description
 - Generate different word embeddings and apply traditional ML algorithms to classify the accident Severity
 - Identify the base line evalutaion metric 
 
 ** Final Report **
 - Used advance Deep Learning techniques to improve on the base line 
 - Experminted with RNN, LSTM and different open source text classification model on Hugging Face Hub
 - Provide business recommendations based on the findings

### Dataset
The accident dataset is provided as part of the course


### Technologies Used
- **Tools:** Python, Google Colab
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit learn, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Hugging Face, NLTK

### Results

 - Achieved 51% F1 score on DistilBert post fine tuning
 - Identified that dataset contained overlapping words across severity levels making the classification challenging
 - Proposed use of a standard template for reporting accidents
